Thank you that means alot xx</p></p><hr><p><strong>Katie Rowe</strong> [2025-04-14T06:59:03.069Z]:<br><p>awwww you shouldn't feel like an idiot, sometimes its good to let it all out. It makes it easier that this job can be flexible to let us be at home when we need to be. <emoji id="smile" alt="🙂" title="Smile"></emoji>&nbsp;If you need anything i am always here for you&nbsp;<emoji id="heart" alt="❤️" title="Heart"></emoji>xxx</p></p><hr><p><strong>Sarah Amison</strong> [2025-04-14T06:49:34.97Z]:<br><p>Last week was hectic and tbh it all happened when you were away she went to see the consultant and they phoned her with the date, which we never expected to be in the next 2 weeks. I had a meltdown to sarah P last week when she asked if I was ok, I felt like a right idiot I` ve just tried to stay busy, think everything just got on top of me xx</p></p><hr><p><strong>Katie Rowe</strong> [2025-04-14T06:47:16.036Z]:<br><p>oh right, no you hadn't said but its good hes let you do that <emoji id="smile" alt="🙂" title="Smile"></emoji>&nbsp;hope all goes well for your mum today then&nbsp;<emoji id="heart" alt="❤️" title="Heart"></emoji>xx</p></p><hr><p><strong>Sarah Amison</strong> [2025-04-14T06:47:06.045Z]:<br><p>My stress levels are through the roof today I`m that worried about Mum it`s probably a good job I`m at home as I`d probably end up having a meltdown&nbsp;<emoji id="cry" alt="😢" title="Crying"></emoji></p></p><hr><p><strong>Sarah Amison</strong> [2025-04-14T06:43:27.782Z]:<br><p>Yeah but it`s ok tbh it saves Mum coming over extra early, I`m working at Home today and Thursday can`t remember whether I told you but Mum is going in the Nuffield today for a Knee replacement so she`s out of action for a couple of months anyway but I spoke to Paul to see if when they go back to school I can work longer at Home start at 6:15 take them to school and get to work for just after 9. He was fine about it and just said just do what you need to do which has taken the pressure off a little, Ben`s Dad has agreed to pick Henry up after school but won`t do the drop off so I`ll pick Isabella as I normally do. It`s all a bit of a nightmare tbh xx</p></p><hr><p><strong>Katie Rowe</strong> [2025-04-14T06:39:05.988Z]:<br><p>I stayed at Paul's so i have come in the office with him.
